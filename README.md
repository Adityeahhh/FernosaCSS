# Fernosa
an upcoming open-source css library currently under development, please dont worry abt optimization, the classes you havent used in the project WILL NOT get added to the css file.

# How to use it?
YOU NEED NODE INSTALLED FOR THE FOLLOWING:

```html
npm init -y
```

then

```html
npm install gulp gulp-sass sass --save-dev
```

```html
npm install --save-dev gulp-purgecss
```

then open the terminal and go to directory. run the command: gulp 

this will start the gulp server which will convert the scss into css.
