an upcoming open-source css library currently under development, please dont worry abt optimization, the classes you havent used in the project WILL NOT get added to the css project.

# How to use it?

ok so first of all downaload the SCSS file from: https://github.com/Adityeahhh/Fernosa/blob/main/Fernosa/fernosa.scss
also download the live sass compiler if you have'nt already, vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass

in the scss file, simply edit the theme colors variables to suit your color theme

like for example change the color blue to gold and it's color value to #FFD700 

after you setup the color palette, click on watch sass which appears on the bottom

and you're done for now! link the css the sass compiler generates to the html and start working.

# Removing the unused css
now that you have finished working, all you need to do is head over to https://purifycss.online
click on the html and css code tab which is right next to webpage url tab
paste the css code from the generated css file and paste your html code, click on clean up css.
BOOM, you have your css file ready
