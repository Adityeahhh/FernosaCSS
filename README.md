<p align="center">Flexible CSS Framework Packed With Responsive Components And Utility</p>
[DISCORD](https://discord.gg/8v6nZH67)

documentation: soon (currently available on discord)

an upcoming open-source css library currently under development, we provide responsive components like footers, navbars, sidenav, forms, etc as well as utility classes, animated buttons, effects and a whole lot more. You just need to paste a few lines of html code and that's it! You dont need to spend hours working on components.

## How to use it?

ok so first of all downaload the SCSS file from: https://github.com/Adityeahhh/Fernosa/blob/main/Fernosa/fernosa.scss
also download the live sass compiler if you have'nt already, vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass

in the scss file, simply edit the theme colors variables to suit your color theme

like for example change the color blue to gold and it's color value to ` #FFD700 `

after you setup the color palette, click on watch sass which appears on the bottom

and you're done for now! link the css the sass compiler generates to the html and start working.

## Removing the unused css
now that you have finished working, all you need to do is head over to https://uncss-online.com
paste the css code from the generated css file and paste your html code, click on uncss my styles and copy the generated code below.
BOOM, just paste the copied code in place of the old css code and you are done!
