## ðŸ‘€ Why Fernosa?
Fernosa is an open-source css library under development. It is customizable to the brink, you can change the colors according to your color palette and based on that the components will be generated, also make the best out of the utility classes we provide to change the components to what you find suitable. Speaking of components, Fernosa comes packed with beautiful and completely responsive components that can be used in your commercial and personal projects, Footers, navbars, sidenav, you name it! Fernosa also gives you the freedom to use a lot css effects that we provide like neon, hover, etc. If you want to speed up your work without wasting hours customizing components, Fernosa is for you.

## How so how do i use it?

first of all downaload the SCSS file from: https://github.com/Adityeahhh/Fernosa/blob/main/Fernosa/fernosa.scss
also download the live sass compiler if you have'nt already, vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass

in the scss file, simply edit the theme colors variables to suit your color theme

after you setup the color palette, click on watch sass which appears on the bottom

and you're done for now! link the css the sass compiler generates to the html and start working.

## Removing the unused css
now that you have finished working, all you need to do is head over to https://uncss-online.com
paste the css code from the generated css file and paste your html code, click on uncss my styles and copy the generated code below.
BOOM, just paste the copied code in place of the old css code and you are done!
